In order for all tests to pass - I had to fork a fellows repo- here's why.
This was forked from Ridwan R. because the instructor Ahmad changed a question from the original file that John created- As a result, 
The npm tests were failing despite the answers being correct. Using Ahamds forked file could not work.
there were many issues with my file as well as other fellows files, that were not passing.
I had to delete my forked file re-create the repo then re-input my answers based on the original file that John created
The file here also includes the answer to Johns original deleted question.
NOW ALL TESTS PASS!
